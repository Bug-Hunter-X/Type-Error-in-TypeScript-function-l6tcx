# Type Error in TypeScript function
This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript where a function expects a string argument, but an array is passed instead. The error occurs because the types don't match, and TypeScript's type system prevents the code from compiling.

The solution shows how to fix this by either changing the function signature to accept an array or modifying the function call to pass a string argument.
